Straight line 
-------------
Minimum points 5 before stable
Length doesn't work....


Sinusoidal
------------
Frequency :
DM - Linear
SOAM - Not great, reaches plateu beyond which only slight change
ICMn - Matches ICMb until about 8, and then linear curve, over 8 linear
ICMb - Near exponential increase, near linear up to 20
NormK & StdAvgK - match both linear

DIAMETER
Basilar artery 3.17mm
Typical basilar amplitude (tested) 7.5mm


SCALABILITY TESTING
-------------------
Scalabilty of the tortuosity metrics seems to be paramount to 
the anaylsis I need to go through all the code and consider the 
dimensions being used and whether they're relevant and what 
units they're in, and what units they should be in. 

centreline_tort_beta (Inputs are centreline and dimension units)
ALWAYS KEEP IN SI UNITS HERE.... i.e. metres

Ensure units are ONLY considered in this function, to simplify.

VOXEL DIMENSIONs of actual data are only added afterwards....we 
want to obtain the "PHYSICAL" tortuosity value, that means applying
the metrics to a centreline that most closely matches the brain.

Then again, if the method (avoiding voxem dimension multiplication)
yields more reliable metrics then we could question the method.

For now, lets focus on physical tortuosity quantification, not in
some abstract scaled space.

So now the simulated centreline should be accurate....

The VITAL question is... What is the relevant parameter space:
What is the expected range of amplitudes....
What is the expected range of frequency etc.
Once I answer this, the data I get from the tester toolbox will 
be more relevant because at the moment it's just tonnes of data.

- WHAT IS A GOOD METRIC?
- WHAT IS THE PARAMETER SCALES OF THE VESSELS?
