# Matlab Toolbox for the Quantification of Cerebral Tortuosity

A collection of code developed with the purpose to quantify the tortuosity ("bendiness") of cerebral blood vessels towards better understanding of age-related strokes.

The toolbox was developed in collaboration with CRIC at Bristol University under the supervision of Dr. Emma Hart.

## Components

1. The vessel extraction and measurement tool
