# Matlab Toolbox for the Quantification of Cerebral Tortuosity

The purpose of this project was to develop a tool to quantify the tortuosity ("bendiness") of cerebral blood vessels towards better understanding of age-related stroke. Various metrics exist in the literature, however no unified testing tool was built to validated and compare across research studies. 

## Components

1. The vessel extraction and measurement tool

2. The simulated vessel metric validation tool:

## Credits

The toolbox was developed in collaboration with CRIC at Bristol University under the supervision of Dr. Emma Hart.
